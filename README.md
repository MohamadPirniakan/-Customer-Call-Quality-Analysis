# Data Analysis and Regression Modeling

This repository provides a Python implementation for loading, exploring, visualizing, preprocessing, and modeling data using regression techniques. The project uses libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn` to handle and analyze the dataset.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Loads a dataset, provides an overview, checks for missing values, and prints dataset information.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates histograms, bar plots, and pair plots for insights into features and relationships.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans data, encodes categorical features, and splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Trains multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Performs grid search to optimize Ridge regression.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models using metrics like RÂ², Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

Install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
